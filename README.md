# BigSpoon-Detection
This repository contains our attempt to use YOLO to detect the object BigSpoon. We collected our own dataset and manually labeled it using YOLO annotation tools to train the model.

Due to file size limitations, the actual YOLO model weights could not be uploaded to this repository.
